## Inspiration
I have spent a few years performing research in the field of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD): Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). In these diseases, inflammation of the intestines cause a variety of unpleasant gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. In the past, I performed examination on the intestinal bacteria of those suffering from these debilitating diseases in order to understand how the composition of these microbial communities change in the disease.
Not only have I had some history of GI problems, but several of my friends have been diagnosed with conditions like CD and irritable bowl syndrome (IBS). I've been thinking a lot about the use of technology in improving quality of medical care, and that thought process and my own experience led me to this idea:
Doctors, when presented with digestive problems, will often ask about frequency and consistency of bowel movements in order to gain insight into gastrointestinal health and abnormalities. Data on the duration of abnormalities (diarrhea or constipation) and patterns in abnormal bowl movements could provide insight into causative factors. However, it is often very hard to remember information about your last bowel movement, so much as one a week ago.
Wearables are an exciting new trend in mobile technology. In my mind, they serve two major purposes: notifications & haptic feedback; and quick access to simple functions which might otherwise be contained in mobile apps (requiring you to take out your phone). I hope to utilize this second purpose (quick entry) in developing a medical monitoring app for the Pebble.
## What it does
There are two components to this application: a Pebble WatchApp written in C which allows for quick entry of stool data; and a webserver/database/website which allows for data storage and viewing.

The WatchApp allows the user to quickly enter in a value from the Bristol stool scale (a system which enables patients to easily communicate the consistency of feces to their doctor)
